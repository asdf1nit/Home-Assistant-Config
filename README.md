### Welcome to my configuration! 

This is a work in progress as all home automation platforms usualy are. I haven't been using home assistant for long as of now( Dec 2018 ) so it's really basic as far as the functionality goes. I did take the time to split all of my configuration now that way it's not so cluttered in the end. I'm running on a rpi 3 b+ for now but I have a nice little quad core nuc I plan on deploying it to along with a few other docker containers for my unifi network and pi hole.


More to come...
